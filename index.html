		<h2>Dreamweaver</h2>

		<div>
			<p>
				Developed and managed by tech giant Adobe Inc, Adobe Dreamweaver CC is a premium, powerful, and
				versatile tool. It caters to both the back-end and front-end development.
				As a closed-source software, Dreamweaver is designed to work within the Adobe ecosystem. Adobe also
				provides support, plugins, and features to make sure you will always code seamlessly.
				Dreamweaver is one of the editors that support both textual and WYSIWYG methods. So, you choose whether
				you want to code with a live visual presentation or go the classical way.

			<ol>
				<h3>Principal functionalities</h3>
				<li>Dreamweaver allows you to write code in any major programming language.</li>
				<li>Supports textual and WYSIWYG editor modes.</li>
				<li>Fully integrated with the Adobe software ecosystem.</li>
				<li>Awesome performance and support from Adobe Inc.</li>

			</ol>
			<ol>
				<h3>Strengh</h3>
				<li>Code and preview. This way developers can code while previewing the end product.</li>
				<li>Confirm the code and page accessibility. This feature can ease the developers to follow Web Content
					Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG.)</li>
				<li>Access to creative cloud libraries. Premium access to the abundant supply of assets in the Adobe
					ecosystem. From colors, words, graphics, layers, characters, and much more.</li>

			</ol>
			<ol>
				<h3>Limits</h3>
				<li>Dreamweaver has a confusing interface that may seem intimidating to new users.</li>
				<li>Its tutorials feature only very basic information, and there are no help guides for more complicated
					topics.</li>
				<li>Dreamweaver's simple point-and-click interface encourages people, especially young students, not to
					invest in learning coding languages, such as HTML and PHP.</li>
				<li>If one were just to write code in Notepad, it would take up almost no space at all. Dreamweaver
					requires 1.8 GB of hard drive space. In addition, each project can take up to hundreds of MBs of
					space, depending on how large it is.</li>
				<li>Dreamweaver has a retail price of about Â£390, as of April 2011, which is hundreds of dollars more
					than similar programs, such as Front Page and NVU. There are many free HTML editors available, as
					well, or one could just code a Web page or an entire website using Window's built-in text editor,
					Notepad.</li>

		<h2>Visual Studio Code</h2>

		<div>
			<p>
				This multi-code free HTML editing tool comes ready to go with a large range of customizable features. It
				prides itself on its smart autocomplete and other intelligent syntax responses. Visual Studio Code is a
				multi-language and multi-platform program. Its development environment works hand in hand with HTML,
				Python and other popular programming languages.

				It is also compatible with Microsoft Azure which makes for easy deployment and numerous extensions.
			<ol>
				<h3>Principals functionnalities</h3>
				<li>IntelliSense allows you to go beyond syntax highlighting and autocomplete. It provides you with
					smart completions based on your types, functions, and modules.</li>
				<li>Customization and features. Install extensions to add languages, themes, debuggers and more.</li>
				<li>The project manager makes it is easily accessible for you to switch back and forth between multiple
					projects.</li>

			</ol>
			<ol>
				<h3>Strenghs</h3>
				<li>Debug your code right from the editor.</li>
				<li>Git commands are built-in. Work with Git and other SCM providers while reviewing diffs, staging
					files, etc. from the editor.</li>
				<li>Live Server extension gives you a live preview of your web application right in the editor.</li>

			</ol>
			<ol>
				<h3>Limits</h3>
				<li>Command Pallete could become a little overwhelming and complex.</li>
				<li>Some programming languages not identified.</li>
				<li>Sometimes terminals get bugged.</li>
				<li>Default key shortcuts make no sense and I had to reconfigure almost all of them</li>
				<li>No git merging, which many people have come to expect as ST3 and Atom have the ability to do that
				</li>

		<h2>Atom</h2>

		<div>
			<p>
				Atom is an HMTL editor that came out in 2014 and gained tremendous momentum since. Atom is a free,
				open-source code editor, and it was developed by the GitHub team. Atom
				uses a free software license for its package and it is maintained by the GitHub community. It aims to
				offer a premium feel to the editor while keeping it completely free. As well as the flexibility to
				customize the software itself.

				As for the tagline, they boast as a hackable text editor for the 21st century. It means that developers
				can contribute to edit, extend, change, and share the program source code as well as create their own
				packages to improve Atom.
			<ol>
				<h3>Principal functionnalities</h3>
				<ol>
					<h3>Principal fonctionalities</h3>
					<li>Atom comes with 81 built-in packages and you can add up to 8,700 additional installable
						packages. You can also develop your own package.</li>
					<li>Open Source Text Editor. The entire Atom editor is a free and open-source program and is
						available at GitHub.</li>
					<li>Smart autocompletion. Atom helps you write your code faster and smarter with a flexible
						autocomplete.</li>
					<li>Supports multiple panes. Atom can split the interface into many windows so you can compare and
						write code side by side</li>

				</ol>
				<ol>
					<h3>Strenghs</h3>
					<li>Customizable. Atom is very easy to customize, tweak how the interface looks and add other
						essential features. You can also build packages and themes from scratch. Or, simply install
						pre-made packages and themes from the community.</li>
					<li>Atom in Dev Mode. You can experiment by adding features to the core system.</li>
					<li>Git and GitHub integration.</li>
					<li>Cross-platform editing. Atom works across all operating systems.</li>

				</ol>
				<ol>
					<h3>Limits</h3>
					<li>Sometimes things do not work as expected. Atom has improved a lot over the last couple of years,
						but it still could use some polish.</li>
					<li>Atom needs plugins for quality-of-life improvements. This is not necessarily a bad thing, as it
						allows you to customize Atom to suit your needs.</li>
					<li>It would be nice if Atom had some recommended starter packages that come with popular plugins
						for highlighting, soft-wrapping and so on.</li>
					<li>There are some plugins that could be turned into core Atom features, like Linter and Beautify.
					</li>

		<h2>Sublime Text</h2>

		<div>
			<p>
				Sublime is another excellent free HTML editor. Developed by a Sydney-based company, this software falls
				under the category of freemium. Freemium means that you can use Sublime for free, but you have to buy a
				license to enjoy the full features. Sublime offers great support to ensure that the program is
				constantly updated. Users can add plugins
				made by the community or build their own. We think using the free version of Sublime is more than
				adequate. However, if you feel like you need more features, you can get the license at a later point.
			<ol>
				<h3>Principals functionnalities</h3>
				<li>Sublime supports Python API that allows the plugin to expand its default functionality.</li>
				<li>Simultaneous editing. You can make changes to many selected areas at the same time.</li>
				<li>Cross-platform. Sublime is available in Windows, OS X, and Linux. Developers only need one license
					to use Sublime on any computers they own.</li>

			</ol>
			<ol>
				<h3>Strenghs</h3>
				<li>Powerful API and package ecosystem. Sublime provides thousands of packages that are available and
					built by the community. These packages are open-source.</li>
				<li>Split editing. Developers can use multiple monitors and edit different types of code simultaneously.
				</li>
				<li>Go to Anything. This feature is useful to open the files with a few keystrokes, to search for
					symbols, lines, or words.</li>
				<li>Go to Definition. Sublime automatically generates a project-wide index of every class, method, and
					function.</li>

			</ol>
			<ol>
				<h3>Limits</h3>
				<li>In addition to the ability to manually comparing the text file, Sublime has the feature of
					automatically comparing the files but it's hard to use and needs to be improved because it's a
					useful feature.</li>
				<li>Although Sublime Text has the features of identifying the many vendor's coding, many other vendors
					coding can not be identifying like Cisco-IOS coding.</li>
				<li>Adding the ability to mark or highlight the text with different colors would be nice.</li>

		<h2>Notepad++</h2>
		<div>
			<p>
				Notepad++ is a free HTML editor that was developed for Windows-based machines. Linux users can also use
				it via Wine. This editor is distributed as free software and its repository is also available in GitHub.
				Like other community projects, third-party plugins are supported.
				Notepad++ distinguishes its development environment for its simplicity. Notepad++ is super lightweight;
				thereâs even a mobile version if you fancy it
			<ol>
				<h3>Principal functionnalities</h3>
				<li>Notepad++ interface is simple, lightweight, and fast.</li>
				<li>It supports multi-language coding environment, from ActionScript, CSS, to visual basic.</li>
				<li>100% compatibility with Windows, although other OSs are not supported (without additional software.)
				</li>

			</ol>
			<ol>
				<h3>Strenghs</h3>
				<li>Itâs completely free and open-source.</li>
				<li>It is Extendable. You can add plugins from the community or create your own.</li>
				<li>Customizable . Developers can personalize the features and interface to their preference.</li>

			</ol>
			<ol>
				<h3>Limits</h3>
				<li>Selecting a programming language should provide user with Auto fill syntax and validation with
					respective programming language.</li>
				<li>Option to save in Google Drive or any storage where the files can be accessed anywhere.</li>
				<li>It has a bit of an old application feel to it. It would be nice to have an updated more modern UI.
				</li>
				<li>Only works in Windows</li>
				<li>Notepad++ does have an issue in displaying and handling very large volumes of data. That is, files
					exceeding 50MB usually lag when opened in Notepad++ and are difficult to copy and paste.</li>
